This project was inspired by an example from the capstone project instructions. 
My MVP was to allow users can enter a question, they will get a randomized response to 
that question, and then that will be saved at the bottom of the page in a "card" until 
the page is refreshed. The web page has a header, main body, and a footer that expands 
with additional cards put in.

To use this webpage, you will need to enter a question where the placeholder text
intstructs you to. Then click the eightball and it will generate a random response in
the bottom input field that will disapear after 2000ms. Once they disapear, a card will
be generated at the bottom of the page with the question asked and the response generated.
